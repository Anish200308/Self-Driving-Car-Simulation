# Self-Driving Car Simulator

A **Self-Driving Car Simulator** built entirely in vanilla JavaScript (with no external libraries) simulating autonomous vehicle behavior through custom-designed road, sensors, controls, neural networks, and visualizers.

## Features

- **Road Design**: A customizable road environment with lanes and obstacles, allowing the self-driving car to navigate through various scenarios.
- **Car Mechanics**: Realistic car driving mechanics, including acceleration, braking, and steering, implemented from scratch.
- **Sensors**: Simulated LIDAR-like sensors that detect obstacles and lane markings, providing input data for decision-making.
- **Collision Detection**: Collision handling between the car and road boundaries or obstacles to evaluate driving performance.
- **Neural Networks**: A simple feed-forward neural network built without libraries to process sensor inputs and generate steering and throttle commands for the car.
- **Control Mechanism**: The neural network outputs are used to control the vehicle's movements, making decisions autonomously based on the sensor data.
- **Visualizer**: Graphical representation of the car's sensors, road, and neural network to help visualize the car’s decision-making process.

## Installation

No external libraries are required. Simply clone the repository, and open the `index.html` file in a browser to run the simulator.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-driving-car-simulator.git
cd self-driving-car-simulator
```

Open `index.html` in your browser.

## How It Works

1. **Car Movement**: The car is controlled by applying forces for acceleration and steering. The car's sensors collect real-time data about the surrounding environment.
2. **Sensor Input**: The sensors detect distances to objects, lanes, and road boundaries. These distances are fed into the neural network.
3. **Neural Network**: The neural network processes the sensor data and outputs steering and acceleration values that control the car's movement.
4. **Visualizer**: The simulator includes a visualizer to monitor the car's real-time decision-making process, showing sensor data and neural network computations.

## Usage

- **Start Simulation**: Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
- **Keyboard Controls**: 
  - Use arrow keys to manually control the car for testing.
  - Toggle between manual and autonomous modes.
  
## Roadmap

- [ ] Add more complex road environments (intersections, curves, etc.).
- [ ] Train the neural network for better driving accuracy.
- [ ] Add reinforcement learning for real-time car training.
- [ ] Improve the neural network's structure to handle more complex scenarios.
